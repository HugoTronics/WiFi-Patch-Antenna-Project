## :open_book: Project Overview

This repository contains resources for building a Wi-Fi patch antenna designed to optimize the network performance of a desktop PC. The project explores the design, simulation, fabrication, and testing of the antenna. You'll find DXF files for antenna designs, STL files for 3D-printed enclosures, and simulation files used during the design phase.

### Features

- **DXF Files**: 2D design files for PCB fabrication.
- **STL Files**: 3D models for printing the antenna enclosure.
- **Simulation Files**: Data and configurations from CST Studio used to optimize the antenna design.

### How to Use

1. **Download the Files**:
   - Clone this repository or download the files directly from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/HugoTronics/WiFi-Patch-Antenna-Project).

2. **Open DXF Files**:
   - Use a CAD software like AutoCAD or Fusion 360 to view and modify the DXF files for PCB manufacturing.

3. **3D Print STL Files**:
   - Use any 3D printer compatible with STL files to print the antenna's enclosure. Recommended material is PETG for durability.

4. **Simulate with CST Studio**:
   - Load the CST Studio simulation file to perform your own design and optimization checks.

## :test_tube: Testing and Validation

1. **Fabrication**:
   - Fabricate the antenna using the DXF design files and assemble it with the 3D-printed enclosure.

2. **Performance Testing**:
   - Test the antenna's performance using a vector network analyzer (VNA) and compare it with the simulation results.

3. **Real-World Testing**:
   - Install the antenna and measure the signal strength improvement using tools like Acrylic Suite.
